# MultiDropdown
## What is MultiDropdown?

MultiDropdown is a CSS plugin for the inuit.css framework. It provides a basic structure for a pure-CSS, infinite level dropdown menu.

## Support

All modern browsers I have tried appear perfect, as does IE8 and above. IE7 has some quirks but is usable.

## Demo
You can view a working demo of this plugin here: (http://samuel-turner.co.uk/demos/multidropdown/latest/)

## Changelog

### V2.0 - 23/11/2013
Huge overhaul, re-written most of the original CSS to work with inuit.css v5.0, used samuelturnerui for styling the demo, moved to a new repo and renamed as igloos don't exist any more and nothing remains of V1.2 making this almost a fresh start.

## To-do

Add mobile/small resolution support.
Add ability to pop out left or right.
